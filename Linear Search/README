# Linear Search Algorithm

Iterates through a list of sorted number array to check if the value exists. If it does exist, then it will return true.

Linear search algorithm is O(n).

If the number that you are searching for exists at the end of the array, then it will need to iterate over the beginning of the array. This makes this algorithm very slow and inefficient.
